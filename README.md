## Name
Crowdfunding_ETL

## Description
Practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Installation
1. Repository Setup:
> Create a new repository named Crowdfunding_ETL.

> Clone the repository to your computer.

> Rename the ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code.ipynb file with the initials and last names (e.g., ETL_Mini_Project_JSmith.ipynb).

> Add the renamed Jupyter notebook file and the Resources folder containing crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx files to the repository.

> Push the changes to GitHub.

> Have your partner pull the changes.

## Roadmap
Add data validation steps. 

Implement more robust error handling.

Automate the ETL pipeline.
